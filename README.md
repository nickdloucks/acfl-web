# ALPINE-CASCADIA FOOTBALL LEAGUE  

The Alpine-Cascadia Football League (ACFL) is an imaginary football league created by Nick Loucks. It evolved from a dice-based football game he developed for his stuffed animals when he was a kid. The latest version of the league features a third-party football simulation video game to simulate the individual games played and to generate statistics for the different players and teams in the league. The ACFL website features a blog of the latest news and game analysis, player and teams stats, league and conference standings, and even recorded footage of the games.

## Conferences:  
- <u>**Marine Conference**</u> (MC)  
    - championship game: _Anchor Bowl_  
- <u>**Spruce Conference**</u> (SC)  
    - championship game: _Ax Bowl_

## Playoffs:  
The two conferences each determine a champion at the end of the regular season by hosting a single-elimination conference championship game between the top two eligble teams. The two conference champions will face off in the final bowl game, the _Alpine Bowl_, to determine the year's League Champion. Conference championship games are played at the home stadium of the team with the better conference record, whereas the _Alpine Bowl_ is always played at a neutral site: Windsor City stadium. In addition to the _Anchor_, _Ax_, and _Alpine_ Bowls, the _Pine Bowl_ is hosted each postseason as a premier matchup between the top two eligbile "at-large" teams not selected to thier respective conference championship games for the year.

## ACFT:  
Each year, the ACFL hosts a league-wide single-elimination tournament before the regular season with seeding based on final league standings of the previous year. The winner of the tournament receives the Cedar Cup trophy. Game results from this tournament do not affect the regular season conference standings nor playoff invitations. Notably however, the games are not considered simply exhibition games, as the results are counted towards the teams' all-time club statistics and records, as well as the rankings throughout the year.
